ðŸ”´ If you have installed AllTalk in a custom Python environment, I will only be able to provide limited assistance/support. AllTalk draws on a variety of scripts and libraries that are not written or managed by myself, and they may fail, error or give strange results in custom built python environments.

ðŸ”´ Please generate a diagnostics report and upload the "diagnostics.log" as this helps me understand your configuration.
